            The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, also known as the Conquest
            of Mexico (1519â€“21),[6] was one of the primary events in the Spanish
            colonization of the Americas. There are multiple 16th-century
            narratives of the events by Spanish conquerors, their indigenous
            allies, and the defeated Aztecs. It was not solely a contest between
            a small contingent of Spaniards defeating the Aztec Empire but
            rather the creation of a coalition of Spanish invaders with
            tributaries to the Aztecs, and most especially the Aztecs'
            indigenous enemies and rivals.

            They combined forces to defeat the Mexica of Tenochtitlan over a
            two-year period. For the Spanish, the expedition to Mexico was part
            of a project of Spanish colonization of the New World after
            twenty-five years of permanent Spanish settlement and further
            exploration in the Caribbean
